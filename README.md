# Update Page Assignment

---

In this assignment students are tasked with taking an outdated web page, updating its design, and then implementing their new design using HTML and CSS.

## Goal

 ---
 
 The goal of this assignment is to have students raelize what's reasonable and what's unreasonable when it comes to implementing a design. By having them update an old design, they are given the structure they need instead of having to completely design their own pages from scratch. If the students try to get too ambitious with their redesign this will serve as a lesson on the their capabilities and limitations when writing HTML and CSS.


## Tasks

---

- [ ] Update the design of the website
- [ ] Implement your updated design using HTML and CSS
